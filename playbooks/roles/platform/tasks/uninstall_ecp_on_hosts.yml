# This task uninstalls ECP components on the designated hosts by running the installer with the --erase option on each host and then removing the installer.
# It uses only one platform variable - platform.install.version as it mostly concerned with file manipulation and does not interact with ECP directly  
# NOTE: Prior to running this playbook, the installer bin file needs to be placed in the /tmp/ecp folder on the Tower server.
